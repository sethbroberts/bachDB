# bachDB
A visual database of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.

Each of Bach's ~1100 catalogued compositions is represented as a dot. 
The size of the dot is roughly proportional to that work's duration.
Dots can be recolored or sorted by different attributes (e.g., genre, key signature).
The DB is searchable by BWV number or title.
Clicking on a dot loads a YouTube performance.
